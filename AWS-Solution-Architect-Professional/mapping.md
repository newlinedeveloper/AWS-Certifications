### **How to Use This Mapping**

1. **Start with Domain 1 projects** to master foundational org-level design.
2. Progress to **Domain 2** to practice designing brand-new workloads.
3. Then do **Domain 3** to learn optimization & continuous improvement.
4. Finish with **Domain 4** for migration & modernization workflows.
5. For each project:

   * Build in your AWS sandbox (free tier where possible).
   * Document architecture diagrams.
   * Test failures, scaling, security scenarios.
   * Compare with **AWS Well-Architected Framework** pillars.
